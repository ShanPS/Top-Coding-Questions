/*
PRIM'S MST ALGORITHM:
    It is a Greedy approach to find the Minimum Spanning Tree for a given connected 
    and undirected graph.

    Steps:
    1) Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST.
    2) Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE.
       Assign key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first.
    3) While mstSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices
        a) Pick a vertex 'u' which is not there in mstSet and has minimum key value.
        b) Include 'u' to mstSet.
        c) Update key value of all adjacent vertices of 'u'. To update the key values, iterate 
           through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex 'v', if weight of edge u-v is less 
           than the previous key value of v, update the key value as weight of u-v

    Time Complexity (using Adjacency Matrix)     : O(V*V)
    Time Complexity (using Adjacency List)       : O(E*log(V))
    Auxiliary Space                              : O(V)         // arrays - parent, key & mstSet
