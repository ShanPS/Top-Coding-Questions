/*
KRUSKAL'S MST ALGORITHM:
    It is a Greedy approach to find the Minimum Spanning Tree for a given connected 
    and undirected graph. (a minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the 
    number of vertices)

    Steps:
    1) Sort all the edges in increasing (or, non-decreasing) order of their weight.
    2) Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far.
       If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
    3) Repeat step2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
    (The step2 uses Find-Union algorithm to detect cycle)


    Time Complexity          : O(E*log(V) + E*log(E))
    Auxiliary Space          : O(V)              // to store results and subsets

    Sorting of edges takes O(E*logE) time.
    After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply find-union algorithm.
    The find and union operations can take atmost O(log(V)) time.
